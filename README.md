# WIP: pi_mote
An IR Remote control application written with Flutter.

This app is intended to interact with a Raspberry Pi over Wi-Fi. Head on over to
my [PiIrRelay](https://github.com/arobinson434/PiIrRelay) project to read about
setting up that side of things.

## Status
This project is very much under construction.

It presently has a single remote  screen with three programmable buttons.

Presently, I am working to add persistence to these buttons. Then, I will
build out a larger, full remote, and will then start to look at adding support
for multiple remotes.

Stay tuned!
