## Overview
This app is part of a larger project to allow you to store infrared (IR) commands
from TV remotes and other common devices on your phone, and then allows you to 
replay those commands. Essentially, this project lets you turn your phone into a
universal remote.

This repo houses the phone app that allows you to build a virtual remote, record
IR commands, and replay commands.

This app is intended to interact with a Raspberry Pi over Wi-Fi. Head on over to
my [PiIrRelay](https://github.com/arobinson434/PiIrRelay) project to read about
setting up that side of things. Needless to say, the Pi handles the physical IR
side of things.

In the end, you can build remotes like this to control your home devices
